## Background
    The inspiration for this visualization tool is based on fantasy sports leagues 
    where the capacity to ascertain and analyze the abilities of indivual players 
    is critical in choosing players during the draft rounds. This visualization tool
    enables the objective comparison of players thus promoting strategic and 
    tactical choices of players during each draft round.
    

## Project Proposal

    Our team will compare player data from the international FIFA soccer video game
    We will visualize player attributes to determine:
  
      1) which attributes contribute to higher competitiveness
      2) Top Players
      3) Attribute distributions
